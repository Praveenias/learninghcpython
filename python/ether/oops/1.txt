#class:

A class is a blueprint or template for creating an object,it contains its own 
behaviour and property

keyword : class

class Praveen:
 pass

#object:
An object is an instance of a class
there can be many object for an single class

real world entity

#constructor
its special method
it will be executed whenever we create an object
it is used to initialize value to the object


#classattributes
this is a varaible that holds value within the class

#classmethods
methods are function that defined within a class


#birds class ("name")
methods:
 sound_system
 lifetime
 colour
 flying_speed
 flying_height


#Encapsulation

Building Data and methods in a a single unit called as class

it restrict access of the object component

encapsulation can be acheived by public,private, protected(access specifiers)

self.public_data = "abc"
self._protected = "protected"
self.__private = "private"


#abastraction

hiding the complex implementation details
nd telling only the important features and workflow


#inhertirtance
#inheariting a child class from the parent class is called as inheritance
#so that it can get all parent properties and behaviours 

existing or parent or base

new or derived or child


class Common:
 def eat():
 print("both veg and non-veg)
  pass

class Animal(Common):
 



#polymorphic

many forms

to write flexible code that can support based on implementation

#method overiding and method overloading


#method overriding

Class Comman:
 def common(self):
 print("in common")

class Base(Common):
def common(self):
 print("in base")

 


method overloading

class Common:
 def add(self,a,b):
  return a+b

 def add(self,a,b,c=none):
 if c==None:c=0
  return a+b+c

def Base(Common):
  pass
